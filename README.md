# Saras Tools - Data Processing Toolkit for SARAS

A set of Python scripts for pre-processing and post-processing data generated by the latest SARAS solver.
Older versions of [SARAS](https://github.com/roshansamuel/saras) solver use a staggered grid,
while the latest [version](https://github.com/roshansamuel/saras-cc) uses a cell-centered collocated configuration.
The scripts in this repo are compatible with the latest version only.

Following are the scripts available so far. More will be added in the course of development.

* Solution Interpolation - The data generated for one grid can be upscaled or downscaled using the script in ``generateSoln``
* Grid Inspection - Get insight into the grid spacing for tangent-hyperbolic grids used by SARAS
* Profile Plot - Plot profiles along 2D cross-sections of a 3D domain

The following Python modules are necessary for the scripts.

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* h5py
* yaml
